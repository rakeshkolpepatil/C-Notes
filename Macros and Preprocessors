Macros
Preprocessors
  - special program invoked by compiler.
  - takes a C program and produces another C program without any #.
  - INCLUDE directive
    -- #include <headerfile.h>
      --- copies contents of headerfile.h into current file
      --- angular brackets - search headerfile.h in standard folders.
    -- #include "headerfile.h"
      --- Double quotes asks preprocessor to search headerfile.h inside current directory.  
    -- ## this is token parsing operator
    -- used for concatinating tokens
    -- a token passed to a macro can be converted to a string using # operator.
    -- The macro can be written on multiple lines using \ and last line should not have it.
    -- macros are not evaluated before macro expansion.
    -- static inline functions should be prefered over macros with arguments.
    -- #undef MACRO_NAME is used to undefine the macros which were defined earlier.
